<h1>I like to create work that give the viewer nostalgic feelings of the simpler times in their life. I do this by incorporating retro music and visuals into my pieces - typically from the early 2000's to the late 80's. I enjoy tackling and exploring the themes of memory and tranquility as well. My inspirations for my artwork come from my own childhood and from my obsession with science fiction and technology.</h1><br><br>
